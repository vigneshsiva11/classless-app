# üö® EXOTEL CONFIGURATION FIX

## The Problem
Currently, when users call your toll-free number **04446313405**, Exotel is calling the wrong endpoint, so users connect to you instead of the AI.

## Current (Wrong) Configuration
```
‚ùå Exotel Voice Webhook: https://yourdomain.com/api/ivr/incoming
```

## Correct Configuration
```
‚úÖ Exotel Voice Webhook: https://yourdomain.com/api/ivr/welcome
```

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Login to Exotel Dashboard
1. Go to [Exotel Dashboard](https://my.exotel.in/)
2. Login with your credentials

### Step 2: Find Voice Configuration
1. Navigate to **Voice** section
2. Find your toll-free number **04446313405**
3. Look for **Webhook URL** or **Callback URL** setting

### Step 3: Update Webhook URL
1. **Change FROM:** `/api/ivr/incoming`
2. **Change TO:** `/api/ivr/welcome`
3. **Save** the configuration

### Step 4: Test
1. Call **04446313405** from another phone
2. You should hear: "Welcome to AI Tutor. Press 1 for SMS learning, Press 2 for Voice learning."
3. Press **2** for voice learning
4. Ask a question like "What is photosynthesis?"
5. **AI should respond, not you!**

## Alternative Solution (Already Implemented)
I've already updated the `/api/ivr/incoming` route to redirect to the AI flow, so it should work even with the current configuration. But it's better to fix the root cause.

## What Happens After Fix

```
User calls 04446313405
         ‚Üì
Exotel ‚Üí ngrok ‚Üí your local server
         ‚Üì
/api/ivr/welcome responds with XML ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
User hears: "Welcome to AI Tutor. Press 1 for SMS learning, Press 2 for Voice learning." ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
User presses 2 ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
/api/ivr/voice-mode responds ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
User asks question ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
AI processes and responds ‚úÖ
```

## Test Your Setup
Open `test-ivr-flow.html` in your browser to test all endpoints locally.

## Need Help?
If you still have issues:
1. Check Exotel dashboard webhook configuration
2. Verify your ngrok URL is correct
3. Test endpoints using the test page
4. Check server logs for errors

## Summary
**The issue is in Exotel configuration, not your code.** Update the webhook URL from `/api/ivr/incoming` to `/api/ivr/welcome` and users will connect directly to AI instead of you.
