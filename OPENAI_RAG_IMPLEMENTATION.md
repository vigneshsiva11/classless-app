# OpenAI RAG Tutor Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tutor using OpenAI, following the exact flow specified in the requirements.

## üöÄ Implementation Overview

The OpenAI RAG implementation follows this exact flow:

```
User Question ‚Üí Query Expansion ‚Üí Document Retrieval ‚Üí OpenAI Generation ‚Üí Answer
```

## üìã Flow Breakdown

### 1. User Question

- User submits a question through the web interface or API
- Example: "What is Newton's law?"

### 2. Query Expansion / Rephrasing

- The system generates 2-3 expanded versions of the question
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to create educational variations
- Example: "What is Newton's law?" ‚Üí "Explain Newton's three laws of motion for Class 9 Physics"

### 3. Document Retrieval

- Searches the vector database using OpenAI embeddings
- Uses `text-embedding-3-small` model for embeddings
- Calculates cosine similarity to find most relevant chunks
- Returns top-k most relevant documents

### 4. OpenAI Generation

- Constructs a prompt with retrieved context and user question
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate natural language answer
- Answer references the retrieved content for accuracy

### 5. Response Delivery

- Returns the generated answer with metadata
- Includes expanded queries and retrieved document information
