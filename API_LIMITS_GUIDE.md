# Gemini API Limits & Rate Limiting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: Rate Limit Exceeded

You're seeing the "Rate limit exceeded" error because you've hit the Gemini API's free tier limits. This is normal and expected behavior.

## 📊 Gemini API Limits

### Free Tier Limits

- **15 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**
- **Image generation may have stricter limits**

### Paid Tier Limits

- **Higher request limits** (varies by plan)
- **Better rate limits**
- **Priority access**

## 🔧 Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait and Retry (Free)

```bash
# Wait for quota reset (usually daily)
# Try again in a few hours
```

### Option 2: Check Your Usage

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Check your current usage and limits
3. See when your quota resets

### Option 3: Upgrade Your Plan

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click on your API key
3. Upgrade to a paid plan for higher limits

## 🛠️ Code Improvements Made

I've updated your code to handle rate limits more gracefully:

### 1. Better Error Messages

- Clear explanation of rate limits
- Helpful suggestions for users
- Better follow-up questions

### 2. Improved Mock Images

- Contextual mock images based on prompts
- Shows appropriate emoji for the requested image
- Clear indication of rate limit status

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

- More informative error responses
- Better guidance for users
- Fallback to text descriptions

## 🧪 Testing Without Rate Limits

### Use Mock Mode

Your system automatically falls back to mock mode when rate limits are hit, so you can still test the interface.

### Test with Different Prompts

Try these prompts to see the improved mock images:

- "Generate an image of a cat" → Shows 🐱
- "Create a sunset image" → Shows 🌅
- "Draw a robot" → Shows 🤖

## 📈 Monitoring API Usage

### Check Your Quota

```bash
# You can check your API usage at:
# https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
```

### Console Logs

Your application logs will show:

- API key status
- Rate limit errors
- Fallback to mock mode

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Implement Caching

```javascript
// Cache generated images to reduce API calls
const imageCache = new Map();
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

```javascript
// Implement client-side rate limiting
const rateLimiter = {
  requests: 0,
  lastReset: Date.now(),
  maxRequests: 10, // per minute
};
```

### 3. User Education

- Explain rate limits to users
- Provide alternatives when limits are hit
- Show estimated wait times

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions

### 1. Use Multiple API Keys

- Rotate between different API keys
- Distribute load across keys

### 2. Implement Queuing

- Queue image generation requests
- Process them when limits reset

### 3. Hybrid Approach

- Use Gemini for text
- Use other services for images
- Fallback to mock images
