## 🚀 Problem Statement

In India, millions of rural and low-income students are **left behind in the digital education revolution** because:

* 📱 Limited or no access to smartphones (shared within families).
* 🌐 Poor or no internet connectivity in villages.
* 🗣️ Existing ed-tech apps prioritize English/urban users, ignoring local languages.
* ❓ Students lack reliable after-school doubt-solving support.

The result? A growing education gap between urban and rural learners.
