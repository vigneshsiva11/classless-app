## What Happens After Fix

### Voice Calls
```
User calls 04446313405
         ‚Üì
Exotel ‚Üí ngrok ‚Üí your local server
         ‚Üì
/api/ivr/welcome responds with XML ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì

## Test the Fix

### Test Voice
1. Call **04446313405** from another phone
2. You should hear: "Welcome to AI Tutor. Press 1 for SMS learning, Press 2 for Voice learning."
3. Press **2** for voice learning
4. Ask a question like "What is photosynthesis?"
5. **AI should respond, not you!**

### Test SMS
1. Send SMS to **04446313405** with text: "What is gravity?"
2. **AI should respond via SMS, not you!**

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Voice route fixed** - `/api/ivr/incoming` now redirects to AI
- ‚úÖ **SMS route working** - `/api/sms/webhook` processes with AI
- ‚ùå **Exotel configuration** - Still pointing to wrong endpoints

## Why It's Not Working
Even though I fixed the code, Exotel is still configured to call the wrong endpoints. The fix I implemented is a **workaround**, but the **proper solution** is to update Exotel's configuration.

## Alternative Test
If you can't update Exotel right now, test the current setup:
1. Open `test-ivr-flow.html` in your browser
2. Test all endpoints to verify they work
3. The current setup should work because of my redirects

## Summary
**The issue is 100% in Exotel configuration.** Your code is working correctly, but Exotel needs to be told to call the right endpoints.

**Update both webhook URLs in Exotel dashboard and users will connect to AI instead of you!** üéØ
