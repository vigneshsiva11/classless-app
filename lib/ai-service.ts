        answer: `Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:

1. **Light Absorption**: Plants capture sunlight using chlorophyll (green pigment)
2. **Carbon Dioxide**: Plants take in CO2 from the air
3. **Water**: Plants absorb water through their roots
4. **Chemical Reaction**: Sunlight + CO2 + H2O ‚Üí Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen
5. **Oxygen Release**: Plants release oxygen as a byproduct

This process is essential for life on Earth as it:
- Provides food for plants and animals
- Produces oxygen for breathing
- Removes CO2 from the atmosphere

Plants are like nature's solar panels, converting sunlight into food! üå±‚òÄÔ∏è`,

        answer: `A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in the form: ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0

**How to solve quadratic equations:**

1. **Factoring Method**: Find two numbers that multiply to 'ac' and add to 'b'
2. **Quadratic Formula**: x = (-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)) / 2a
3. **Completing the Square**: Rewrite in the form (x + h)¬≤ = k

**Example**: Solve x¬≤ + 5x + 6 = 0
- Factoring: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
- Solutions: x = -2 or x = -3

**Key Points:**
- Always check if the equation can be factored first
- Use the quadratic formula as a backup method
- The discriminant (b¬≤ - 4ac) tells you about the nature of solutions

- Provide detailed, accurate explanations
- Include examples and step-by-step solutions
- Suggest follow-up questions for deeper learning
- Adapt my response to your grade level and subject

1. Get a Gemini API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Add GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key to .env.local file
3. Restart the server
